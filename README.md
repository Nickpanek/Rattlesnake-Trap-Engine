The Rattlesnake Engine

🐍 About The Project

The Rattlesnake Engine is a proprietary generative music engine designed to automate the composition of "Trap" and "Drill" music. Unlike standard MIDI sequencers, this engine utilizes Biomimetic Topology to mathematically simulate the movement of a snake.

This repository serves as the immutable timestamp and proof of ownership for the source code, the generative algorithms, and the resulting asset library.
🛠️ Technical Architecture

The engine functions as a "Virtual Ecosystem" executing a biological score:

    The Slither Function: The 808 Sub-Bass does not move linearly; it follows a Damped Sine Wave (M * e^-t * sin(wt)), creating a physical "wobble" that mimics serpentine locomotion.

    The Rattle Geometry: High-frequency percussion (Hi-Hats) utilizes an Exponential Acceleration Curve, mathematically replicating the increasing buzz of a tail rattle before a strike.

    The Venom Constraint: Strictly enforces the Phrygian Minor Second (Semitone Interval) to create an aggressive, dissonant atmosphere.

📦 The Asset Library

This repository contains the "Panek Trap Collection", a verified library of unique musical compositions generated by this engine.

    Manifest: Panek_Trap_Manifest.csv (Internal to the zip archive).

    Archive: NickPanek_Trap_Collection.zip (The complete collection of MIDI assets).
